# Phase 2: Scalable and Beautiful Food Delivery Application Development

## 1. Requirement Analysis (Scalability & UI Focus)

- [ ] **Analyze Scalability Requirements:**
    - [ ] Define precise metrics for 10,000 concurrent users (e.g., requests per second, response time targets).
    - [ ] Identify peak load scenarios and usage patterns.
    - [ ] Research and document best practices for high-concurrency applications.
- [ ] **Analyze UI/UX Requirements ("Beautiful App")**:
    - [ ] Research modern UI/UX trends for food delivery applications.
    - [ ] Define target aesthetic and user experience goals (e.g., intuitive, engaging, accessible).
    - [ ] (If possible) Gather visual inspiration or style guides if the user has preferences.
- [ ] **Review Existing `todo.md` (from Phase 1) for feature alignment with new quality attributes.**

## 2. System Architecture Design (High Concurrency)

- [ ] **Design Scalable Backend Architecture:**
    - [ ] Choose appropriate technology stack (e.g., microservices, serverless, specific frameworks).
    - [ ] Design for horizontal scaling.
    - [ ] Plan for load balancing.
    - [ ] Design database for high read/write throughput and concurrency (e.g., NoSQL options, sharding, read replicas).
- [ ] **Design Real-time Communication Architecture:**
    - [ ] Select technology for real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets, message queues like Kafka/RabbitMQ, Supabase Realtime at scale).
- [ ] **Plan Infrastructure and Deployment Strategy:**
    - [ ] Choose cloud provider and services (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
    - [ ] Plan for auto-scaling infrastructure.
    - [ ] Define CI/CD pipeline strategy.

## 3. UI/UX Design (Beautiful & Modern)

- [ ] **Create High-Fidelity Mockups/Prototypes for all 4 Apps + Admin Dashboard:**
    - [ ] Focus on intuitive navigation and user flow.
    - [ ] Incorporate modern design principles and aesthetics.
    - [ ] Ensure responsive design for various devices.
    - [ ] Design for accessibility (WCAG guidelines).
- [ ] **Develop a Component Library/Design System:**
    - [ ] Create reusable UI components for consistency.

## 4. Development & Implementation (Scalable Backend & DB)

- [ ] **Develop Backend Services/APIs based on new architecture.**
- [ ] **Implement Scalable Database Schema and optimize queries.**
- [ ] **Implement Real-time Features.**
- [ ] **Develop Frontend for all 4 Apps + Admin Dashboard based on new UI/UX designs.**
- [ ] **Integrate with Payment Gateways, Mapping Services, Notification Services.**

## 5. Comprehensive & Performance Testing

- [ ] **Develop Unit and Integration Tests.**
- [ ] **Conduct Performance and Load Testing:**
    - [ ] Simulate 10,000 concurrent users.
    - [ ] Test for bottlenecks and optimize.
    - [ ] Test database performance under load.
- [ ] **Conduct Security Testing.**
- [ ] **Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).**

## 6. Launch Preparation & Execution

- [ ] **Prepare Deployment Plan:**
    - [ ] Staging environment setup.
    - [ ] Production environment setup.
    - [ ] Data migration plan (if applicable).
- [ ] **Set up Monitoring and Alerting:**
    - [ ] Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).
    - [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues.
- [ ] **Execute Launch (Phased or Full Rollout).**
- [ ] **Post-launch Monitoring and Stabilization.**

## 7. Validation & Documentation

- [ ] **Validate System Performance against 10,000 concurrent user target.**
- [ ] **Validate User Experience and UI beauty based on feedback.**
- [ ] **Compile Comprehensive System Documentation:**
    - [ ] Architecture diagrams.
    - [ ] API documentation.
    - [ ] Deployment guides.
    - [ ] Updated user manuals.
