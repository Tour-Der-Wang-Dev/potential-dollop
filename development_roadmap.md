## Phase 3: Core Driver & Admin Modules + Initial New Feature Integration

*   **Driver Module (Basic):**
    *   Driver registration and profile management.
    *   View available delivery tasks/orders in their area.
    *   Accept delivery tasks.
    *   Update delivery status (e.g., Picked Up, En Route, Delivered).

    *   Admin login.
    *   User management: View list of all users (customers, restaurant owners, drivers), activate/deactivate accounts, manage roles.
    *   Restaurant management: View list of restaurants, approve new restaurant registrations, manage restaurant details.
    *   Order overview: View all orders in the system, filter by status/restaurant/customer.
*   **Real-time Shop Visit Counter (Initial Implementation):**
    *   Implement a basic real-time counter for how many users are currently viewing a specific restaurant's page.
    *   Technology to be used: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing updates to the client.
    *   Display this count on the restaurant's public page.
*   **Chat System (Initial - User-to-Restaurant):**
    *   Implement one-on-one chat functionality between a customer and a restaurant, specifically tied to an active order.
    *   Basic UI for sending and receiving messages.
    *   Message persistence in the database.
    *   Technology to be used: WebSockets for real-time communication.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features, Refinements & Expanded Chat/Analytics

*   **Chat System (Expanded):**
    *   User-to-Driver chat for delivery coordination.
    *   Restaurant-to-Driver chat for order handoff.
    *   Real-time notifications for new chat messages (in-app or browser notifications).
    *   Consider message history access and search if feasible.
*   **Real-time Shop Visit Counter (Enhanced):**
    *   If required, expand to include simple historical trends (e.g., peak visit times).
    *   Ensure scalability for many concurrent viewers.
*   **Search & Filtering Enhancements:**
    *   Advanced search for menu items across all restaurants.
    *   More filter options (e.g., price range, delivery time, ratings).
*   **Reviews and Ratings System:**
    *   Customers can rate and review restaurants and specific menu items.
    *   Display average ratings.
*   **Notifications System:**
    *   In-app and/or email/SMS notifications for critical order updates (order confirmed, dispatched, delivered, cancelled).
*   **Promotions/Discounts Module (Basic):**
    *   Restaurants can create simple promotional codes.
    *   Customers can apply promo codes at checkout.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration (Placeholder):**
    *   Research and plan for integration with a payment gateway (actual implementation is a large task and may require user intervention for sensitive details).

## General Considerations for Each Phase:

*   **Database Schema Design/Updates:** Evolve the database schema to support new features.
*   **API Endpoint Development:** Create robust and secure API endpoints for all functionalities.
*   **Frontend Development:** Develop responsive and user-friendly HTML templates and JavaScript interactions for each feature.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end testing for user flows.
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices (input validation, authentication, authorization, protection against common web vulnerabilities).
*   **Deployment:** Regular updates to the deployed application after each significant phase or feature set completion.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the Food Delivery App. We will proceed step-by-step, focusing on delivering functional modules incrementally.
