Prompt for Designing a Database Schema for a Food Delivery Application
🎯 Objective
Guide lovable.dev to design a database schema for a Food Delivery application that includes entities like customers, restaurants, drivers, orders, and menu items, ensuring proper relationships and data integrity.
Context
You are tasked with creating a database schema for a Food Delivery application. The application needs to manage customers, restaurants, drivers, orders, and menu items. The schema should be designed to handle operations efficiently and maintain data integrity.
📝 Details Required

Entities:
Customers
Restaurants
Drivers
Orders
Menu Items


Relationships:
Customers place orders.
Restaurants have menu items.
Orders are associated with customers, restaurants, and drivers.
Drivers deliver orders.


Fields and Data Types:
Each entity should have appropriate fields with correct data types.
Include primary keys, foreign keys, and any necessary constraints.


Supabase Integration:
Consider using Supabase's features like Row Level Security (RLS) for managing access to data.



✨ Expected Output
A detailed database schema including:

Table definitions with fields and data types.
Relationships between tables (e.g., foreign keys).
Any indexes or constraints necessary for performance and data integrity.
Suggestions for implementing Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

💡 Additional Considerations

Ensure the schema is normalized to at least the third normal form (3NF) to avoid data redundancy.
Consider the scalability of the schema for handling a large number of orders and users.
Think about how real-time updates (e.g., order status changes) might be handled using Supabase's Realtime features.
